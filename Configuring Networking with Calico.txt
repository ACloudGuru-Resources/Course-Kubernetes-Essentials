# CHAPTER 2.6 - Configuring Networking with Calico
# https://learn.acloud.guru/course/2e0bad96-a602-4c91-9da2-e757d32abb8f/learn/56bea242-4b92-4bcb-ad80-f974467c8d7a/88143593-a2b1-4ee3-8791-2ba9350c39f9/watch

# Install Calico in the cluster by running this only on the Master node:

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.25.0/manifests/calico.yaml

# Verify that all the nodes now have a STATUS of "Ready":

kubectl get nodes

# You should see all three of your servers listed, and all should have a STATUS of "Ready". It should look something like this:

NAME                           STATUS   ROLES           AGE     VERSION
155f1d1c831c.mylabserver.com   Ready    control-plane   4m53s   v1.30.3
155f1d1c832c.mylabserver.com   Ready    <none>          3m9s    v1.30.3
155f1d1c833c.mylabserver.com   Ready    <none>          2m44s   v1.30.3

# Note: It may take a few moments for all nodes to enter the "Ready" status, so if they are not all "Ready", wait a few moments and try again.

# It is also a good idea to verify that the Calico pods are up and running. Run this command to get a list of system pods:

kubectl get pods -n kube-system

# Expected output:

NAME                                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

# You should have three pods with "calico" in the name, and all three should have a status of "Running".
